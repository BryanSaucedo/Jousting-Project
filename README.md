# Jousting-Project
Joust is a Go CLI game simulating turn-based battles between knights. Players configure stamina, weapons, and hit chances via flags. The program models knights and weapons with structs, uses method receivers for actions, tracks stamina and mount status, and outputs live battle updates until a winner is determined.
